CLI to convert raw HTML into kotlin HTML DSL

This is just a tiny, very imperfect software that I quickly hacked over lunchtime for my own personal use.

It is not meant to be good or useful beyond my own personal use, and the generated code may not be always correct.

At the moment, I have no plan to distribute this software.

If you are interested in this project, you're probably better off building your own, eventually using this repo as an example of how it can be done.
